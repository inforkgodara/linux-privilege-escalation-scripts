# Linux Privilege Escalation Scripts

The repository has scripts that search for possible paths to escalate privileges on Linux/Unix*/MacOS hosts. Purpose of the repository to make easy to get the script for linux privilege escalation in one directory all scripts will be stored so it would be handy for me. All credit goes to hardworking respective developers.

Note: Make sure you change the permission to run chmod 600 SCRIPT_NAME.
